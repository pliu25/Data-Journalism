<h1>Tracking Dogs in New York City</h1>
<p>In this investigation, I'll be exploring the number of dogs in New York City, as well as the number of various different breeds. 
   My set of data tracks active dog licenses from 2016 to 2023. All dog owners in NYC are required by law to license their dogs, so I think 
   this data set is relatively good at representing the number of dogs in NYC. The dataset tracks each dog's name, breed, zipcode of residence, and the year the dog's license 
   is active. I will specifically be looking at NYC dogs in 2023, as it's the most recent year available. Because the dataset tracks the year the dog license was active, I think it's 
   pretty representative of the number of dogs in NYC in each specific year, or 2023 in this case. My macro page will be a map of NYC split by zipcode, with the number of dogs in each 
   zipcode detailed. My micro pages will be bar charts per zipcode tracking the number of dogs per dog breed. I chose this topic because I thought it was the most interesting one and 
   I love dogs! I also thought it would be fun to design my page with photos of adorable dogs!
