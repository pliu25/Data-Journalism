<h1>Tracking Dogs in New York City</h1>
<p>In this investigation, I'll be exploring the number of dogs in New York City, as well as the number of various different breeds. 
   My set of data tracks active dog licenses from 2016 to 2023. All dog owners in NYC are required by law to license their dogs, so I think 
   this data set is relatively good at representing the number of dogs in NYC. I pared down the dataset so it tracks each dog's name, breed, zipcode of residence, and the year the dog's license 
   is active (more on the specifics under <a href="#DataCleansingPipeline">Data Cleansing Pipeline</a>). I will specifically be looking at NYC dogs in 2023, as it's the most recent year available and I wanted to pare down my 600K+ entry dataset. Because the dataset tracks the year the dog license was active, I think it's 
   pretty representative of the number of dogs in NYC in each specific year, or 2023 in this case. My macro page will be a map of NYC split by zipcode, with the number of dogs in each 
   zipcode detailed. My micro pages will be bar charts per zipcode tracking the number of dogs per dog breed. I chose this topic because I thought it was the most interesting one and 
   I love dogs! I also thought it would be fun to design my page with photos of adorable dogs!

<p> The original dataset had a dog's name, sex, birth year, breed, license issue date, expired year, and data extraction year. By removing columns in Excel, I pared down the dataset 
    so it initially only had the dog's name, breed, and data extraction year. Then, since I'm only looking at NYC zipcodes, I removed all non-NYC zipcodes by first googling the range of NYC zipcodes (10001 - 11697) and then removing all data entries with zipcodes 
    outside of that range, including four-digit zipcodes that might have just been typos. I made this process easier for myself by using an Excel function to sort all data entries by the chronological order of the zipcodes, and then removing entries less than 10001 and more than 
    11697. After, since I decided to just look at dog licenses during 2023, I removed all data entries not from 2023. This process was similar to my removal of non-NYC zipcodes---I sorted the dataset by the chronological order of the extract years and then removed all non-2023 years. 
    Thus, I pared down my data from 600K+ entries to about 108K and so it fit both my macro and micro pages!
